Hello, my name is Henrique Boaventura.

I code [stuff][coding].

I also like [beer] and [judge it][judge], and have a [podcast] about homebrewing.

Sometimes I mix both beer and code and create things like this:
- [scoresheets.cc]
- [bjcp-score]

But for the most part I do [consulting].

You can also send me an [e-mail] if you like to.

[portuguÃªs, por favor][pt] / [Deutsch, bitte][de]
